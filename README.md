# Foobar

In this project, I decided to use a state management technology according to the size of the project. Since the project is not a very big project in terms of data, I did not use the Redux library that I use professionally in this project. I used Context API and Query String technology in this project.


## Installation


```bash
yarn install
yarn start

```



# Used technologies

```
# Sass

# Swiper

# momentjs

# axios

# react-i18next (For Change Language)

# react-icons
```
