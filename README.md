# Foobar

In this project, I decided to use a state management technology according to the size of the project. Since the project is not a very big project in terms of data, I did not use the Redux library that I use professionally in this project. I used Context API and Query String technology in this project.
In this project, I could have done most operations with simple methods, but I did not do this. I wanted to show how to show my knowledge of javascript. I strained my javascirpt knowledge. And I wanted to use javascript in the most effective way.
